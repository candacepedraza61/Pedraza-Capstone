<p> The planet is heating up and experiencing more extreme weather events as a result of the climate crisis. </p>

<p> According to <a href="https://climate.selectra.com/en/news/ipcc-report-2022#:~:text=The%20IPCC%20report%202022%20warned,help%20prevent%20an%20environmental%20disaster."> a report </a> this year from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a working group borne from the United Nations, only the most extreme action on the crisis will help to keep temperatures down and prevent the global temperature from increasing past 1.5 degrees celcius.</p>

<p> In New York City, residents are experiencing the brunt of extreme heat and flooding, with transportation becoming more vulnerable to flood events and with heatwaves leading to higher hospitalization rates.</p>

<p> The following is a series of stories done that focus on both the potential impact of the climate crisis on the city, as well as a focus on the solutions that have come from the crisis impacting city neighborhoods.</p>

<h1>New Yorkers With Disabilities Won Accessible Evacuation Centers. Good Luck Getting There on Staten Island.</h1>
<h4> by Candace Pedraza </h4>
<h4> Originally published in <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2022/7/5/23195595/new-yorkers-disabilities-accessible-evacuation-centers-staten-island"> THE CITY </a> on Jul. 5, 2022</h4>

<p> Fati Vuillemey, who uses a motorized wheelchair, says she’s had numerous issues using Access-a-Ride to get around on Staten Island.</p>

<p> Living in her second-floor apartment, she could not imagine how, when an emergency arises, she would be able to even escape from her home. </p>

<p> “My living situation was an emergency, and it took two years to take care of. Every night, my anxiety is, when I lay down on the pillow, if there’s a fire, how am I able to escape? That’s not a quality of life,” said Vuillemey.</p>

<p> Cheri Rosen, who also uses a motorized wheelchair, recalled a time during Hurricane Sandy when cars and vans that were part of a fleet of emergency vehicles meant for residents with disabilities started to flood and she feared not being able to evacuate safely. </p>

<p> Both women were part of a group of people with disabilities who met at the Staten Island Center for Independent Living, or SCIL, on a recent Tuesday afternoon to share their stories about issues with transportation, not only in an emergency, but to and from doctor’s appointments, work, and school. </p>

<p> They also highlighted a hole in emergency planning that the city has conducted in case of a flood event, and a lack of consideration for people with disabilities trying to get out of their homes and to accessible evacuation centers on Staten Island. </p>

<p> The women said that the plans that New York City has in place for people with disabilities do not go far enough to ensure they can actually get above ground and to safety in a flood. </p>

<p> Many of their concerns focused on Access-a-Ride, the city’s expensive and unwieldy system that uses private drivers to provide public transportation for New Yorkers with disabilities or health conditions that keep them from using buses or subways.</p>

<p> The women said that between confusing routes, being forced to wait for rides to reach them on Staten Island from distant boroughs, and drivers who are not familiar with the borough at all, it’s hard to believe the system would be able to accommodate them during an emergency. </p>

<p> Carla Brodsky, a supervisor at SICIL, said that more often than not those waiting on Access-a-Ride or other modes of transportation have better luck relying on “the kindness of strangers.” </p>

<p> “How important it is to make people with disabilities a part of the conversation — who best can describe the barriers they face when dealing with Access-a-Ride and evacuation?” said Brodsky. </p>

<p> With experts predicting an especially <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2022-atlantic-hurricane-season">active hurricane season</a>, the women meeting at SCIL question whether Access-a-Ride or other public transportation services would be able to transport people with disabilities in outer boroughs to the accessible evacuation centers nearest to them. </p>

<p> “That’s the thing. Who wants to come to Staten Island? You’d get the thing saying ‘due to the storm, Access-a-Ride will not be having any driving,’” said Rosen of how emergency alerts could fail her.</p>

<p> Another member of the group, Wanda Lewis, echoed Rosen’s sentiment of frustration over lack of options on the island during a storm:</p>

<p> “You’d have to get on a boat.” </p>

<h3> In the Zone </h3>

<p> New York City’s Office of Emergency Management has <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/em/html/know-your-zone/knowyourzone.html"> established “zones”</a> throughout the five boroughs, with areas in zone one being at the most at risk for flooding and those in zone six at the least. On Staten Island, the coasts are almost entirely in zone one. Further inland, the island has five evacuation centers, with four of them — PS 80 Petrides Complex, Curtis High School, PS 58, IS 51 and the Jerome Parker Campus — accessible to people with disabilities.</p>

<p> That represents progress since <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2019/7/30/21210904/city-nearly-two-years-late-on-making-60-evacuation-shelters-accessible"> THE CITY reported </a> on disparities in 2019. But after <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2011cv06690/385198/66/0.pdf?ts=1411560455"> a lawsuit</a> brought by the Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled, or BCID, and other disability rights organizations following Hurricane Irene in 2011 finally led to an increase in the number of accessible evacuation centers, people with disabilities still need to find a way to get to them. </p>

<p> Joe Rappaport, the executive director of BCID, said that Irene pushed himself and other advocates to take action against the city in what was a dangerous, life-threatening situation for residents unable to get to evacuation centers in time. And, even when they did, they faced issues in buildings that were supposed to be accessible.</p>

<p> Jean Ryan, who is a part of a non-profit advocacy group called Disabled in Action and uses a wheelchair, said that even with more accessible evacuation centers, the reliance on Access-a-Ride and its private drivers and dispatchers makes it hard to hold the city-subsidized operation to its promises to help out after a flood. </p>

<p> Ryan also expressed concerns over the size of the vehicles that Access-a-Ride uses to transport people with disabilities and in some cases, people with wheelchairs. </p>

<p> “If you have wheelchair users being evacuated, the cabs and car services, the transport people now, they can only really take one person at a time. One wheelchair user at a time. Not three, like the big vans can,” said Ryan. </p>

<p> She said that an incentive like extra pay for drivers during storms would make Access-a-Ride drivers and dispatchers more motivated to help out those with disabilities in flood zones throughout the city rather than leaving such people to formulate their own evacuation plan in the absence of sufficient support.</p>

<h3> Revamped Planning </h3>

<p> The OEM and the MTA plan to partner in a future flood where evacuation transportation is needed city-wide according to Nicole Payne, the director of transportation and infrastructure with the New York City Emergency Management Department. </p>

<p> They recommend that every New Yorker “knows their zone,” and make plans now to respond to an emergency. </p>

<p> “It’s really important that people heed the messaging, that they heed the advice to evacuate. So when evacuation orders are issued, New Yorkers can actually call 311 to be connected to support services for, specifically, again, for people with mobility issues, disabilities and functional needs, who need evacuation support,” said Payne. </p>

<p> The MTA asks that those who need Access-a-Ride services for evacuating their home call the agency at least 24-72 hours prior to a storm landing to reserve a trip. They offer service to evacuation centers across the five boroughs. </p>

<p> Even with the city’s precautions and plans, though, many Staten Island residents with disabilities feel they are being left to figure things out on their own, including Access-a-Ride already unreliable service and assistance getting out of apartments that are not on the first floor. </p>

<p> Access-a-Ride <a href="http://aardashboard.mta.info/"> has seen an increase</a> in on-time drivers on Staten Island, with on-time performance rising from 91% to 95% between September 2021 and April 2022.</p>

<p> That followed a major slump in on-time performance that led to hearings on the service’s shortcomings in September of 2021 when there was a 121% percent increase in no-show complaints. <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/11/17/22788573/access-a-ride-failing-mta-paratransit-service-drops"> Members of the community </a> voiced their frustrations with how unreliable the ride service had become.</p>

<p> But even with that incremental improvement, members of the SICIL group aren’t satisfied that they would be safe using the service to escape from a flood or other natural disaster. </p>

<p> Said Rosen, “The only way they’ll help you is if you already have a trip booked. I think I go to Petrides School to evacuate. I don’t know these cross streets, I can’t guarantee that. Who do I call to get which entrance I have to come in from? They drop you off where the address is, but the only accessible entrance is elsewhere. How can I find that? How am I going to know that?”</p>

<h1>MTA’s On-Street Bus Chargers Need More Flood Protection, Study Warns</h1>

<h4> by Candace Pedraza</h4>
<h4> Originally published in <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2022/12/6/23495512/electric-bus-chargers-need-flood-protection">THE CITY</a> on Dec. 6, 2022</h4>

<p> The MTA’s surface fleet of nearly 6,000 buses is supposed to get a jolt of life with 60 more electric buses set to hit the streets sometime next year, but experts say the juice docks for the vehicles could be a liability. </p>

<p> While this adds four times the number of buses to the <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/04/22/mta-to-add-60-electric-buses-by-years-end/"> 15 electric buses</a> currently in use, a new study suggests the on-street chargers that power these buses need more flood protections.</p>

<p> The study, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361920922000852"> published recently</a>in the peer-reviewed scientific journal “Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment,” seeks to determine just how protected or unprotected the city’s current bus chargers would be during storms and floods of the kind that NYC has experienced this century. The analysis used flood prediction information from both <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data.page">NYC Open Data</a> and the <a href="https://msc.fema.gov/portal/search?#searchresultsanchor">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>;maps of the B32 and M42 bus routes, which have electric buses in their fleets; simulations of random power outages, and the locations of current on-street charging stations. </p>

<p> In every scenario tested, one or both of the routes’ on-street chargers were compromised by flooding or power outages, contradicting the MTA’s belief that an East Side on-street charger in the study is not currently vulnerable to flooding. </p>

<p> In three of the more severe scenarios, in which floodwaters could top three feet, not only would the fast on-street chargers be compromised, but the maintenance that the chargers would need after being flooded — like using backup power generators, or needing to switch out bus batteries by hand — would cause delays on these two routes. </p>

<p> “I wasn’t totally surprised to see the depot would be flooded,” said Maya Tessler, a oceanography masters student at Louisiana State University. Tessler co-authored the report with Elizabeth Traut, an affiliate assistant research professor at Penn State University. “One would think they’d protect them. In the future, it would save them a lot of money if they did.”</p>

<h3> Planning for Storms</h3>

<p> The depots that Tessler is referring to are the larger buildings where buses are parked up for either charging or refueling, depending on the type of bus. Those depots, as a result of post-Sandy resiliency efforts, are supposed to eventually be flood-protected, but there is no time frame for when they will be completely protected. </p>

<p> But THE CITY <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/11/30/21754533/mta-plan-electric-buses-climate-change">reported in 2020</a>hat many of them may not stand up to a strong storm, according to a <a href="https://www.tstc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/09-29-2020_Resiliency-Report.pdf">report</a>from the nonprofit Tri-State Transportation Campaign.</p>

<p> On-street chargers have so far not been as scrutinized. </p>

<p> The new study finds that, without flood-protected chargers, the city could lose $945,000 in revenue per day from loss of service on the B32 route from Williamsburg in Brooklyn to Long Island City in Queens, and another $10,400,000 per day from the M42 route, which cuts across Manhattan from West 42nd Street to East 41st Street. </p>

<p> Traut argued that long-term vision is necessary to combat climate change and the extreme weather conditions that come with it. </p>

<p> “Looking at the last 100 years is not enough. You need to look at the next 500,” said Traut.  “You’ll save a lot of money, a lot of planning, and save a lot of lives.”</p>

<h3> Solutions Exist</h3>

<p> The study notes that solutions already exist, and could be easily implemented over time by the MTA, which faces a <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-mta-electric-battery-buses-schumer-federal-funding-20220810-5ibasrwidzc2thhk5cunpbbfea-story.html">state mandate</a>to electrify its entire fleet by 2040.</p>

<p> Potential fixes include <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/environment/2022/4/27/23045575/mta-surging-ahead-with-electric-bus-plans">having</a>portable diesel generators to power stations, solar paneling, barriers around chargers, and swapping batteries out at stations during emergencies. </p>

<p> “One thing that people are interested in is new technology. [But] we can address climate change using existing tech. We don’t need new tech to solve this problem,” said Traut. </p>

<p> The MTA acknowledges that the West Side charger that supplies power to the M42 electric bus route is in a flood-prone area, and officials plan on testing flood barriers for that location, according to spokesperson Sean Butler. </p>

<p> But, Butler said, “given the location of the E. 42nd St charger is not flood-prone, it does not have any specific flood protection measures.”</p>

<h3> Protecting Power Sources </h3>

<p> According to the city comptroller’s recent report, <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/wp-content/uploads/documents/Ten-Years-After-Sandy.pdf">“Ten Years After Sandy: Barriers to Resilience,”</a>over $142 million has been allotted towards Department of Transportation efforts to make roadways and bridges more resilient, with nearly half of that money spent so far. </p>

<p> In April 2022, the MTA did a presentation alongside Gov. Kathy Hochul on <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/environment/2022/4/27/23045575/mta-surging-ahead-with-electric-bus-plans?_amp=true">its plans to convert</a>its entire fleet, explaining that the amount of additional power needed would be around 370 additional megawatts — enough to light a small city. </p>

<p> Kevin Garcia, the transportation planner with the nonprofit New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, said that the MTA should make sure it is using renewable energy as it adds more electric vehicles. </p>

<p> “If they are seeking to deploy more on-street charging, going the route of building out flood barriers, building up solar panels around the street chargers can definitely help to improve their resilience,” he said. “Build out these chargers so they may be on higher ground or be on a platform that could potentially help make sure that these chargers continue to work during flooding events.” </p>

<p> Garcia noted the Albany passage of two bills, <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/S3535">SB3535</a> and <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/A3090">A3090</a>, in the state Senate and Assembly related to the purchase of electric bus fleets across New York could make these resiliency efforts for on-street chargers more important to prioritize. </p>

<p> These two bills would ensure that by 2029, all buses procured by the state would need to be electric. The bill has passed the state Senate but has yet to pass the Assembly. </p>

<p> “I think the pandemic has really shown who continues to ride public transit, you know, when these national-global events take place. And what we’ve seen from the events of Hurricane Sandy 10 years ago, or Hurricane Ida, which was a little bit more recent, folks are still riding public transit, whether it’s a subway or buses,” said Garcia. “We want to make sure that this mode of transportation is still accessible and still operating so that folks can get home safely.”</p>

<p> Christine Kirchhoff, an associate professor of Law Policy and Engineering at Penn State University who was not involved with the study, said that the amount of carbon emissions the city would be preventing by continuing to add to their electric bus fleet while also protecting their on-street chargers from flooding is important given that we are not inundated with flood events “365 days out of the year, yet.”</p>

<p> “But, that’s coming down the road,” said Kirchhoff. </p>

<p> She also added that it’s wise for the city’s emergency management team to take community feedback into consideration, and to understand the importance of prioritizing certain protections over others. </p>

<p> “I think it’s hard to physically protect everything,” she said. “There’s always choices. Do we invest in the extra protections needed to protect every single one of these on street chargers, or do we balance that with protecting something else that may not be a high priority for residents in a particular area?”</p>

<h1>Heat guns, drones, and cooler paths taken: how one CUNY school is helping Bed-Stuy tackle heat.</h1>
<h4> by Candace Pedraza</h4>

<p> When Dr. Reginald Blake did a nature walk in Bedford-Stuyvesant in 2011, the “genesis” of what would become a community-wide heat tracking project began to take shape. </p>

<p> Blake, the Associate Provost, Dean of Curriculum and a professor in the Physics Department at the New York City College of Technology, was invited on this walk through the community as an expert on environmental issues to help teach residents about the cooling impact of trees. </p>

<p> After that walk, Blake was connected with an environmental justice group, Magnolia Tree Earth Center, who he partnered with on a community-wide project that aimed to show young campers how hot their neighborhood was becoming because of the urban heat island effect. </p>

<p> Blake and a group of researchers from City Tech embarked on a summer-long quest in collaboration with a local summer camp in Bed-Stuy about how to use heat guns, drones, and graphs to determine what parts of their neighborhood were hottest, and which were coolest.</p>

<p> Blake, as well as the Magnolia Tree Earth Center, wanted to make sure that through any work done for and with constituents in Bed-Stuy on environmental education, no one felt taken advantage of. </p>

<p> “We recognized early that African-American neighborhoods, for a long time, have been rather skeptical about inviting folks in. Particularly scientists. They always felt as if they were being exploited. Folks come in, get the data, get the information, and then leave, with nothing in return,” said Blake. </p>

<p> The experience, Blake said, was eye opening for the boys involved. </p>

<p> “Their eyes were wide open. They were so excited to see the drone moving up in the air, and realizing you could get thermal temperatures from above. It was so mind boggling to these young men,” said Blake. </p>

<p> Teaching them how to use heat guns that measured the temperature of a surface, how to fly drones to capture those temperatures from above them, and how to graph areas with the most heat in their neighborhoods using satellite imagery, pencils and paper was just one of the ways that Blake and his team wanted to provide real education on the issue of the climate crisis, and how its impact goes beyond major storms like Hurricane Sandy or Ida. </p>

<p> “They had heard of climate change, but they couldn’t understand the relevance,” said Blake.</p>

<p> According to Blake, After using these tools and learning how to use them in their own neighborhood, “Life made more sense.”</p>

<iframe width="500" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/En1srWgdnHc">
</iframe>

<p> Sandy brought a surge, and Ida brought flooding. The next storm, due to the climate crisis, can be worse than both. With temperatures rising and with sea levels rising, coastal cities like New York City have to adjust their infrastructure for what’s to come. </p>

<p> That means making greener, cooler spaces especially for areas sorely needing the cooldown like Bed-Stuy. </p>

<p> This area experiences the urban heat island effect, which means that during periods of high temperatures, the amount of concrete and asphalt in the area leads to trapped heat in the ground. This can seep out into the air, making the “real feel” of a neighborhood hotter than what it actually is. </p>

<p> With the lack of trees in Bed-Stuy coupled with the amount of concrete and roadways cutting through the neighborhood, it’s an issue that continues to persist and worsen due to the climate crisis. </p>

<p> Assemblymember Stefani Zinerman (D-NY) who represents Bed-Stuy and who has worked closely with Blake on his research and community outreach, said those spaces are especially needed for the community’s most vulnerable residents, like seniors and disabled Brooklynites just trying to use playgrounds or walk to the store. </p>

<p> “When you can walk around your neighborhood, go from one park to the other, and see there's no kids playing in this park. And it's because they know that they don’t have choices.
They know that there's something wrong,” said Zinerman of the importance of cooler infrastructure, and cooler parks specifically in her neighborhood. </p>

<p> When she learned about the work that Blake and his team was planning on doing in Bed-Stuy, she was immediately intrigued. A third generation farmer, Zinerman said a big focus of what she wants to accomplish as an elected official is introducing environmental education to her constituents. </p>

<p> It’s important to her and to Blake that they know there’s a way to track just how bad heat is in their neighborhood because it can be such a strain on their “psyche,” as well as on their physical health. </p>

<p> “You know, it's so important to have these types of projects just to keep people informed. And we actually had a conversation, community conversation about the possible linkages to, you know, community violence,” said Zinerman in regards to the impact of heat on her neighborhood. </p>

<p> Next summer, Blake and his team are hoping for a few updates to their project. For starters, they plan on creating an app so that any data gathered by the youth camp they work with next will get uploaded and stored somewhere. That way, residents can actually see which path is coolest in their area for the safest routes to and from home. </p>

<p> Another addition to his work will be incorporating the lesson plans of high school and middle school teachers and students into local public schools. This way, knowledge on how to use tools like heat guns or drones, or knowledge of how heat islands are created, is not kept to just private schools. </p>

<p> “So that they can be taken to the classroom that’s derived from NASA’s latest and greatest tools so students who are underserved can do the kinds of research that we’re talking about doing,” said Blake. </p>

<p> More importantly to Blake, though, is his team’s plan to continue to attend community board meetings along with Zinerman to keep presenting the findings of not only their team, but of the children of their own neighborhood during these summer camps. </p>

<p> Blake expressed that the community board “want to know what’s going on, they want to know how’s this going to benefit the community in the role of protecting their citizens and sustaining the neighborhood.” </p>

<p> “We didn’t just go to Bed-Stuy for science. If there was a community fair and young folks were having. Marching band, something community related, we were there. If there was a board meeting, we were there. It’s easier to talk to them. No one knows the science of the community, the needs of a community better than them. This was not a one shot deal, this was not just folks getting information for a paper. No, we made sure we were a part of the community.” </p>
